ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project analyzes the infamous Titanic disaster using classification models to predict passenger survival based on various features. 
The study compares the performance of Decision Tree and NaÃ¯ve Bayes models using the KNIME analytics platform.

ðŸŽ¯ Aims & Methodology

Goal: Predict passenger survival using classification techniques.

Models Implemented:

Decision Tree

NaÃ¯ve Bayes

Tool Used: KNIME (via drag-and-drop nodes).

Approach:

Data preprocessing and feature exploration.

Model training with cross-validation.

Performance evaluation on multiple metrics.

ðŸ“Š Results & Discussion

Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Cohenâ€™s Kappa.

Findings:

Decision Tree consistently outperformed NaÃ¯ve Bayes across all metrics.

Final test accuracy of Decision Tree: 85.4%.

Confusion matrix indicated strong TP and TN rates.

ROC curve values > 0.5 confirmed model reliability.

âœ… Conclusion

The Decision Tree model proved superior for this binary classification task compared to NaÃ¯ve Bayes. 
Future enhancements could include ensemble learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest) to boost performance further.
